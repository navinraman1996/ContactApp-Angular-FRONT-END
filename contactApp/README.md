## Project Description : 
* Creating a simple javascript web application for an address book using angularjs.Angular HTTP client module is used to fetch data from the Nodejs server.The HttpClient in @angular/common/http offers a simplified client HTTP API for Angular applications that rests on the XMLHttpRequest interface exposed by browsers. Additional benefits of HttpClient include testability features, typed request and response objects, request and response interception, Observable apis, and streamlined error handling.Angular component and data binding features are used.Data-binding can be either one-way or two-way. Angular provides various types of data binding -

String Interpolation
Property Binding
Event Binding
Two-way binding


## Requirement :
* Visual Studio code and a web browser which supports ES6.


## How to run :
* STEPS :
1.Open a git bash shell
2.Execute a command "https://github.com/neu-mis-info6150-spring-2019/assignment-9-navinraman"
3.Open files with visual studio code in a new workspace.
4.Open a new teminal by right clicking on project folder.
5.Execute a command "npm install -g @angular/cli".
6.Execute a command "ng new ng6-proj --style=scss --routing" for installing a new angular project called ng6-proj.
7.Execute a command "ng serve -o" to launch the code editor.
8.Components and services are created and HTTP client module is used to fetch data from the Nodejs server.
9.Right click on index.html and click on revel in explore
10.Double click and execute index.html
11.Enjoy the buid of an address book Application.
